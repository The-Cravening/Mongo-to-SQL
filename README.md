# Mongo To SQL Converter
This is only a proof-of-concept tool that creates an SQL string from a MongoDB database.

**Disclaimer:** Largely untested and lacking in features. May encounter issues with large databases.

# Instructions
1. Run the server using `python3 server.py` or `python server.py` if Python 3 is your default version.
2. In a browser navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
3. Enter MongoDB details and click the convert button.

## Reason for Cravening
Moving from one database type to another causes a lot of issues and should be avoided at all costs - AKA proper planning.
